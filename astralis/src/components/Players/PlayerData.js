  bio : <span>Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander is by far the biggest in-game leader in CS:GO.
     His ability to lead and guide his teammates is unbelievable and this is the main
      reason why Astralis found success in recent years.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      Born on June 7, 1995 in Copenhagen, Denmark, Lukas Rossander simply wanted to compete in his life.
       At first, he had nothing do to with gaming as he was only interested in soccer.
       Did you know that Lukas played soccer with several players that are playing in the best leagues right now? 
       For instance, he played alongside Andreas Christensen, a center-back that is currently in Chelsea.
        However, a career-defining
       injury separated him from the soccer field and he looked for competition elsewhere.

       <br/>
       <br/>
       Once he turned 14, Rossander replaced the soccer boots with a mouse and keyboard.
        He fell in love with Counter-Strike in a gaming café where he saw that everyone
         played this FPS title.After spending most of his money buying minutes to use the PC in the gaming café, gla1ve’s 
         mother decided that it would be cheaper to just buy him the game.
         <br/>
      <br/>
         Lukas put a lot of time and effort into the game and he was really intrigued by the professional Counter-Strike scene. 
         As you can imagine, he desperately wanted to join in on the action. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      His CS:GO days were kickstarted with Copenhagen Wolves. 
      They won several low-tier events, but once they played against the best teams, they struggled hard.
      Gla1ve jumped to lots of teams in Denmark, however he wasn't successful in those organizations .
      Until 10/2016, gla1ve joined Astralis, after that is legendary.

  bio : <span>Nicolai “device” Reedtz. The Danish superstar is leaving a huge mark on the CS scene and we can without a doubt say that Reedtz is one of the best CS:GO pros of all time.<br/><br/>
    Nicolai Reedtz was born on September 8 1995 in Vejle, Denmark. Surely in his early years, 
    he never imagined that he would become one of the best CS:GO professional players out there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just like every other professional player, 
    Nicolai started gaming early in his life and main influence back then was his brother.
    Also he got into sports – he played badminton and was very good at it.
    At one point, young Reedtz was approached by the best badminton team in his town but he refused to sign with them. 
    Later on, he injured his knee and that sealed his badminton career.
    <br /><br />
    Like most on the competitive gaming scene, Nicolai did not get
     the support he needed when he was still a teenager.
     Who listens to a teenager talking about going pro into gaming?
     <br /><br />
     The Danish AWPer started his career in the Copenhagen Wolves as “device”, where his results were fairly mediocre and no one would have guessed what he was capable of.
     In 2014, device was brought in to refresh a very solid Dignitas lineup. However, he never found his footing there and not long after that, he was on the lookout for a new CS:GO team.
     <br /><br />The breakout year for device turned out to be 2015 as he was finally able to put himself on the map. Team SoloMid were already an established organization and the only thing they lacked was a quality AWPer. They finally got that in Nicolai who quickly topped the charts.
     <br /><br />However, management problems occurred during his time in Team SoloMid, and in 2016, device joined an all-Danish CS:GO roster: Astralis, where he found his family.

  bio : <span>{bold('Andreas "Xyp9x" Højsleth')} (born September 11, 1995) is a Danish professional 
    {bold(' Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player')} for Astralis and a former semi-professional 
    Counter-Strike player.
     He is famous for his high success rate in clutches, being dubbed the "clutch minister" 
     by the community(generated after a image about Danish Prime minister shake with Xyp9x) .<br/><br/>
     Earlier day, like most of every other proplayers, Xyp9x has a brother and he was the one who
lead our {bold('Clutch Minister')} into CS. Before the arrival of {bold('CS:GO')} , the Counter Strike was split between 
 {bold(' CS 1.6')} and {bold('CS Source')}, Xyp9x was firmly in the 1.6 camp mostly by inheritance from his brother. He didn't have
much time to play since his family only had 1 computer and most of the time Xyp9x's brother would play the game.
Therefore, Xyp9x watched over his brother's shoulder, passively analyzing CS and that can explain why the Clutch Minister
have a decent knowledge about the game.
<br/><br/>
    Early in his career, he played CS 1.6 but unsuccessfully proved his name to the commnunity. However, when it 
    come to CS:GO , thing was kickstarted. Xyp9x was invited to {bold('Fnatic')}, then {bold('Copenhagen Wolves')} where he met {bold('dev1ce')} and
    {bold(' dupreeh')}, the trio play together through many organizations and later 
    is {bold('Astralis')}, where the legend story of the Clutch Minister was written.

    Emil never set out to become a professional {bold("Counter-Strike")} player. It just kind of happened.

    demonstrated a natural affinity for the game.
    <br /><br />
    At the early time of the career, Magisk join semi-professional team named {bold("stfuNerd")} and {bold("MTw")}. After that 
    he was invited to stand-in for {bold("SK Gaming")} due to the departure of {bold("konfig")}. Emil starting to build 
    his reputation at several tournaments with {bold("SK Gaming")}, {bold("Team Dignitas")}, {bold("North")} and {bold("OpTic Gaming")}.
    However, he couldn't play as a top-tier because of his inconsistency. 
    <br /><br />
    At 2018, Kjaerbye left {bold("Astralis")} to sign a contract with {bold("North")} which {bold("dev1ce")}
    tell that like the betrayal. At first, the Danes organization's first plan was sign
